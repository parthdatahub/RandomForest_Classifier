# Random Forest Classifier with Hyperparameter Tuning and Data Balancing

Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions to make the final classification. This repository provides an overview of the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, along with hyperparameter tuning techniques and strategies to handle imbalanced datasets.

## Random Forest Classifier Algorithm Interview Questions

1. **What is Ensemble Learning?**
   Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models (e.g., decision trees) to improve the overall performance and generalization ability.

2. **What is the basic idea behind Random Forest Classifier?**
   Random Forest Classifier builds multiple decision trees using random subsets of the training data and random subsets of features. It aggregates the predictions of these trees to make the final classification.

3. **What are the hyperparameters in Random Forest Classifier?**
   Random Forest Classifier has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize its performance, including:
   - Number of trees (n_estimators)
   - Maximum depth of trees (max_depth)
   - Minimum number of samples required to split a node (min_samples_split)
   - Minimum number of samples required in a leaf node (min_samples_leaf)

4. **What is Hyperparameter Tuning in Random Forest Classifier?**
   Hyperparameter tuning in Random Forest Classifier is the process of finding the optimal values for the hyperparameters. It involves systematically searching through a range of hyperparameter values to find the combination that yields the best performance.

5. **What are some common methods for Hyperparameter Tuning in Random Forest Classifier?**
   Some common methods for hyperparameter tuning in Random Forest Classifier include:
   - Grid Search: Exhaustively searching through a predefined set of hyperparameter values.
   - Random Search: Randomly sampling hyperparameter values from a specified range.
   - Bayesian Optimization: Using probabilistic models to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters.

6. **How can you handle imbalanced datasets in Random Forest Classifier?**
   Handling imbalanced datasets in Random Forest Classifier can be done using various techniques:
   - Resampling: Either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class to balance the dataset.
   - Class weights: Assigning higher weights to the minority class during training to give it more importance.

7. **What are the advantages of Random Forest Classifier?**
   - Robust to overfitting due to ensemble learning.
   - Can handle large datasets with high dimensionality.
   - Can provide feature importance rankings.

8. **What are some common methods to measure feature importance in Random Forest Classifier?**
   Some common methods to measure feature importance in Random Forest Classifier include:
   - Gini impurity: Measures the total reduction of impurity achieved by a feature across all trees.
   - Mean decrease accuracy: Measures the average decrease in accuracy when a feature is removed from the dataset.

9. **When should you use Random Forest Classifier over other classification algorithms?**
   Random Forest Classifier is suitable for various classification tasks, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data, non-linear relationships, and the need for robustness against overfitting.
